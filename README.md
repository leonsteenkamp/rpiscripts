# rpiscripts
Some Raspberry Pi scripts and stuff.

netcheck.sh - Check if the RPi's network interface is up, if not, then take
              the interface down and bring back up again, using mostly for WiFi.

browserdiaply.sh - open a page in the browser from ssh terminal session and go
                   fullscreen, then refresh page every few minutes.
